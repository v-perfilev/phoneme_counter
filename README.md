# Phonemes Counter

This project develops a deep learning model designed to accurately count phonemes 
in audio recordings of varying lengths. Utilizing a recurrent neural network 
architecture enhanced with an attention mechanism, the model processes 
spectrogram tensors to predict the phoneme count. 
The model is built with PyTorch.
